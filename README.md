# PlaydateKitTemplate

This is a template package for [PlaydateKit](https://github.com/finnvoor/PlaydateKit).

## How to Use
For detailed instructions and documentation on how to get started creating a game using PlaydateKit, see [here](https://github.com/finnvoor/PlaydateKit/documentation/playdatekit).

1. Install a recent nightly [Swift](https://www.swift.org/download/#snapshots) toolchain that supports the Embedded experimental feature.
2. Install the [Playdate SDK](https://play.date/dev/).
3. Create a new repository using this template.
4. Build and run directly in the simulator using Xcode, or build using the command `swift package pdc`. When built using `swift package`, the built `pdx` game file will be located at `.build/plugins/PDCPlugin/outputs/PlaydateKitTemplate.pdx` and can be opened in the Playdate simulator.
